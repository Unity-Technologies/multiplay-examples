Unity Simple Game Client Example

This sample represents your game client which will be distributed to players. Here it is a very simple client
which connects to the matchmaker and asks for a game. When the matchmaker receives enough players and has allocated
a match it will then tell this client where to connect to.

Once connected this game client will stay connected until the match end, and then exit.
