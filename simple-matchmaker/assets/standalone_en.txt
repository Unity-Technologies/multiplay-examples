The matchmaker is running in standalone mode.

In this mode it will still matchmake players in groups. however the match will send players to a TCP mirror running
inside this simple matchmaker.

This is designed to allow you to play around with how this matchmaker works fully standalone and is not representative
of a full allocation/deallocation flow you would see in a real game.
