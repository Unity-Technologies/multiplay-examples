Unity Simple Matchmaker Example

To use multiplay, most games need a matchmaker which groups players.
For the most streamlined experience we recommend that you use the unity matchmaker to do this, but you may use an
alternative or your own custom implementation.

This sample provides an incredibly simple matchmaker to get you started locally. It will group incoming players
together and when enough have joined it will request a match from either its multiplay mock, or the real multiplay API.

Authentication is provided through environmental variables. You may set this in your system environmental variables
or may temporarily set this for your terminal session as shown below.

Windows Example:
set MP_ACCESS_KEY=9ff2af788834439b83ae6692f34ea5e5
set MP_SECRET_KEY=6323354e200a451dba319bc1b98ade59

For example on UNIX Style OS (OSX, Linux, BSD):
export MP_ACCESS_KEY=9ff2af788834439b83ae6692f34ea5e5
export MP_SECRET_KEY=6323354e200a451dba319bc1b98ade59
